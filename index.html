            <h2>The Public Storage facility at 625 Stella Street in Fort Worth is unsafe.</h2>
            <p>If you are looking for storage in the Fort Worth area, it's very likely that you've seen the facility on 625 Stella Street. It's one of the largest facilities in the area, and it's flooded with overwhelmingly positive reviews. Do not believe the reviews. Comb through them carefully.</p>
            <p>This location is possibly the most unsafe storage facility in the area. Going through Google Reviews, you will notice that many of the negative reviews mention the poor condition of the facility and how often it is burglarized.</p>
            <p>Although there have been more than a dozen reported burglaries of this facility in 2023 alone, and probably many more that go unreported, I would like to focus particularly on one story that was covered by the Fort Worth Star-Telegram: <a href="https://www.star-telegram.com/news/local/crime/article280700965.html" target="_blank">‘Very upsetting’: Thieves hit Fort Worth storage units twice; $50K in rare items lost</a></p>

            <h3>Questionable reviews</h3>
            <p>It is very common for storage facilities to incentivize their location to garner positive reviews. I have personally been solicited to leave a positive review for an employee after having a positive exchange with one.</p>
            <p>The reviews on PublicStorage.com are pulled from each facility's Google Reviews page. You will notice that many of the positive reviews are very vague and broad, and they often mention employees by name. This may be indicative of review incentives. These reviews seem very unnatural. If you continue scrolling, you will then see that the negative reviews are very much more detailed and read completely differently.</p>
            <p>You cannot trust the reviews for Public Storage's facilities. For this particular 625 Stella Street location, there are mentions of rampant burglaries, the facility being in disrepair, and even people camping out inside of the facility. These are quickly flooded out by reviews in the nature of, "Billy was so fantastic!"</p>
            <h3>Alleged 24/7 security</h3>
            <p>The location in Fort Worth at 625 Stella Street does not have 24/7 security. They will lie and claim they do.</p>
            <p>The definition of security is "the state of being free from danger or threat." Examples of security are monitored cameras, alarms, etc. This facility only has cameras. Cameras do nothing to protect the customer. They exist to serve the facility and benefit their legal liability. According to the Property Manager (Bryant, at the time), many halls and areas of this location are also completely blind to cameras.</p>
            <h3>Misleading crime statistics</h3>
            <p>When a burglary occurs at a Public Storage facility, there is no policy requiring them to report it (according to the District Manager of the 625 Stella Street, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/troy-galer-a665927" target="_blank">Troy Galer</a>). It is left up to the customer to report the burglary, <strong>even if the facility exhibits signs of a forced entry</strong>.</p>
            <p>However, why would a Public Storage location want to report a crime at their facility? It does not benefit them. They've already tricked you into their rental and insurance agreement trap. As far as they are concerned, whatever happens to your things are for you to deal with.</p>
            <p>If you look up a Public Storage facility's reported burglaries, this number is the absolute bare minimum number of burglaries at the location. It will practically always be underreported. The Fort Worth Star-Telegram article states that "Public Storage on Stella Street for break-in calls 13 times so far this year, according to police records," but I would be willing to bet anything that the real number is above 15. Keep in mind that these are incidents, not customers being victimized—a single burglary <a href="https://www.ksat.com/news/local/2023/03/07/4-arrested-in-connection-with-burglaries-of-200-storage-units-in-bexar-county-deputies-say/" target="_blank">can affect hundreds of units</a>.</p>
            <h3>Disrepair and safety concerns</h3>
            <p>Many areas of this facility appear to be falling into disrepair.</p>

            <p class="photo-credit">One of the women's bathroom doors on October 16, 2023. The door cannot be closed due to its condition.</p>
            <p>Reviewers as recently as July 2023 state that the halls of the third floor in this facility are difficult to walk through. Bryan Phillips alleges that there were "campers in his aisle," which seems to imply that there are people living in units at the facility at some capacity. This is a safety risk and against practically every competent storage facility's policies.</p>
            <h3>Faulty doors and motion sensor</h3>
            <p>Has your storage unit been burglarized at the Public Storage facility on 625 Stella Street? Did you see no signs of forced entry? Have you been curious why? If your case is anything like Craig and Angela's, it's because the doors and motion sensor are faulty and open for criminals.</p>
            <img src="doors.jpg" alt="Doors at the entrance to the Public Storage facility on 625 Stella Street in Fort Worth, TX">
            <p class="photo-credit">These doors are the only barrier between the freeway and this facility's indoor storage units.</p>
            <p>Craig and Angela were confused at how the facility was left without much damage other than to their storage unit door. This had originally led them to believe that this was an inside job. When asking to see the "24/7 security" camera footage of the burglary, they were told that it was against Public Storage policy to do such a thing.</p>
            <p>After their storage unit was burglarized for a second time less than 48 hours later, the Property Manager suddenly allowed Angela to view the camera footage, alongside the Fort Worth Police. In this footage, an officer of the Fort Worth Police was able to confirm that the burglars entered the facility the same exact way both times—<strong>by sticking a wire hanger through the doors to trigger the motion sensor on the inside of the doors, thus causing the doors to open</strong>.</p>
            <img src="sensor.jpg" alt="Motion sensor on the inside of the doors to the Public Storage facility on 625 Stella Street in Fort Worth, TX">
            <p class="photo-credit">This motion sensor has been exploited during at least two burglaries at the 625 Stella Street Public Storage location.</p>
            <p>For this to happen not once, but twice, and possibly even many times before, is a clear sign of negligence. What is the Property Manager doing all day if not addressing issues such as this? Customers are not being made aware of such incompetent security issues when they sign their rental agreement. With access to footage from previous burglaries, it is not possible for staff at this location to be unaware of the weakness in this facility's doors and motion sensor.</p>
            <h3>Customer-last service</h3>
            <p>It's important to understand that Public Storage staff are not on the customer's side. If you have ever interacted with one and asked them tough questions, you will quickly realize that they've been trained to minimize the company's liabilities and place the responsibility of everything on the customer.</p>
            <p>Once you have signed your rental agreement, it seems like they believe their job is done. If anything happens at the facility, they will use the rental agreement as a catch-all get-out-of-jail-free card. Their job is not to protect your belongings. Their job is to get you to sign a rental agreement and pay them. From that point on, you're on your own.</p>
            <p>The 625 Stella Street location's Property Manager, Bryant, called Angela to inform her that her locks were cut off of her unit around 2pm CDT. Access to the property opens at 6am CDT, and the property office opens at 9:30pm CDT. What is it that a Property Manager is doing for the first near-five hours of their work day if not surveying the property to ensure that customers' units were kept safe overnight?</p>

            <p>After his storage unit was burglarized for a second time in 48 hours, Craig contacted the District Manager, Troy Galer, about the situation. Troy appeared totally unaware of what was going on at the 625 Stella Street facility and offered to call him back.</p>
            <p>After a few minutes, Craig received a call back. Instead of providing solutions and an explanation of how his facility could be compromised the same exact way in 48 hours, due to the poor design of their doors and motion sensor, Troy reminded Craig that he had signed a rental agreement (which he only signed under the promise of a 24/7-secured facility). Troy then insisted that his facility was just as much a victim of the burglaries because the doors of the affected storage units would need repairs.</p>
            <p>When asked any difficult questions, Troy would respond with something to the like of, "Er, wh—, no—," before finally managing, "I don't believe this is a productive conversation."</p>

            <p>Not a single employee at the 625 Stella Street location, the company's lawyer (who they referred a reporter to), or the District Manager of this location can explain any of this. They are not on your side. They do not care about your customer experience.</p>
